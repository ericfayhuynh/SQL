## Module 9 Chellenge

This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis. We will be using quickdatabasediagrams, SQL, and Python (Jupyter Notebook) for this challenge.

## Background
It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.
For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.


## Data Modeling
I used QuickDatabaseDiagrams to create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and the corresponding SQL query to create the table schemas. This application is free, and it provides an export function that allows me to export the PostgreSQL table schema query for creating the tables.

The exported file, "quickdatabasetext.txt," contains the text that the program understands and uses to generate a visual table diagram showing the tables, primary keys, foreign keys, entity relationships across tables, and data types. Additionally, I have included a screenshot file named "quickdatabasediagrams.png" to provide a visual representation of what you would see when the "quickdatabasetext.txt" is input into the program.
